Presented script is an implementation of the algorithm which has been developed as a master thesis project. Thi is my method for automatically determining routes for network analysis inside buildings. The repository presents the developed algorithm and a script that executes it on sample data. The script was created based on data collected in the "Geoportal AGH" project.
